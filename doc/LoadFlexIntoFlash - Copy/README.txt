Flex Into Flash examples

Notes:

1) Very crude example - sorry, no time so deconstruct at your own pace :)

2) The myFlexApp.mxml was used to generate myFlexApp.swf for Flex -> Flash example.

3) Open the Loader.fla file in FCS3 and execute from within the IDE.

4) You will get a sandbox violation if you attempt to execute Loader.swf standalone - easily compensated for but is 
   left to you as it's outside the scope of the example.

5) For Flex <- Flex example, create a new project using the FlexIntoFlex.mxml file and test from within Flex.

6) Cleaner ways exist to do this, so experiment and have fun!!

7) If you use this in a commercial project and make a lot of $$$, then hit my PayPal account or at least
   remember me in your will :)
